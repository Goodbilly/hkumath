## HKU Math Courses

This blog shares about my study journey and mostly about university mathematics. I will update the website from time to time. :wave:_

**How to use it?**: Go to [Courses](https://goodbilly.github.io/hkumath/). Then, enter the passwords for the notes.

**What is a profile README?**: A _[profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)_ is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page. For more information, see "[Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to your newly made repository. Then, work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository.

3. Click on the **main** branch drop-down.

4. In the field, name your branch `my-first-branch`. In this case, the name must be `my-first-branch` to trigger the course workflow.
5. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** to create your branch.

   The branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created.
   The **main** branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
